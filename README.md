#Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant threat in todayâ€™s digital world, leading to substantial financial losses for both individuals and organizations. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. By identifying potentially fraudulent activities, the model helps prevent unauthorized transactions, thereby protecting consumers and businesses from financial fraud.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following:

Dataset: Preprocessed credit card transaction data, containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.
Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and fraud detection.
README: Project documentation.
Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical data. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset (with far more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones), the project focuses on handling data imbalance, improving model precision, and minimizing false positives.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
Modeling: Different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained and evaluated to select the best-performing model.
Evaluation: The model is tested using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling are used to address data imbalance issues.
